### Problem Definition and Opportunity Selection

**Selected Enterprise Project: Web-based Mentorship Management System for Educational Institutions**

#### Problem Description and Selection Rationale

The educational sector faces significant challenges in managing mentorship programs effectively. Through extensive research and personal observation, I identified a critical gap in how educational institutions coordinate mentor-mentee relationships, schedule sessions, and track progress. Traditional methods rely heavily on manual processes, spreadsheets, and disconnected communication channels, leading to:

1. **Inefficient Matching Process**: Manual assignment of mentors to mentees often results in mismatched skill sets and learning objectives
2. **Poor Communication**: Lack of centralized communication platform leads to missed sessions and unclear expectations
3. **Limited Progress Tracking**: No systematic way to monitor mentee development or mentor effectiveness
4. **Administrative Overhead**: Staff spend excessive time on paperwork and coordination rather than focusing on educational outcomes
